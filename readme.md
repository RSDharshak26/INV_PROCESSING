general info : 


Client side = where user interacts with the system
Server = powerful computer that stores the website's code and data


In the modern world, Client side rendering is low and only for components that require user interaction. Most of the rendering is done by the server. CSR is enabled by 'use client' and the browser does it. 

useState and useEffect are Client components that are called React Hooks.
useState = components memory
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);  //NUll = INITIAL VALUE
                                        // USER = current val
                                        //setUser = updating val

useEffect = components side jobs
checklist of tasks to do after component has been displayed.
tasks : any work that isn't directly related to drawing the component, like fetching data, setting up subscriptions, or talking to browser APIs.
Syntax: useEffect(() => { ... }, []);
The first argument () => { ... } is the "side job" you want to run.
The second argument [] is the dependency array. An empty array [] means: "Only run this side job once, right after the component first appears on the screen."
