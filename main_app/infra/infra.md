When an interviewer asks you to “walk me through your template” they’re rarely testing whether you’ve memorized every CloudFormation property. They want to know:

Your Intent & Scope

What problem are you solving? e.g. “I need a secure, highly‐available container platform for web and API services.”

What constraints or non­functional requirements matter? (cost control, autoscaling, multi­AZ failover, zero-trust networking, etc.)

The High­Level Architecture

Network layout: “I create a VPC with public subnets for the ALB and private subnets for my Fargate tasks, connected via an Internet Gateway and (in prod) NAT gateways for safe egress.”

Compute & Runtime: “I use ECS Fargate so I don’t manage EC2 hosts; each task gets its own ENI with awsvpc networking.”

Load balancing & routing: “An Application Load Balancer fronts both services—default routes to frontend; path‐based routing (/receive*) to the backend.”

Security Posture

Least-privilege IAM: “Tasks assume an execution role that only allows pulling images and writing logs.”

Security groups: “The ALB SG only accepts HTTP/HTTPS from the internet; the container SG only accepts traffic from the ALB on specific ports.”

Private vs public: “Backend tasks live in private subnets with no direct public IP.”

Reliability & Scalability

Multi­AZ deployment: “Subnets in two AZs guard against zone failures.”

DesiredCount + auto­sclaing: “You’d hook up Service auto­sclaing to CPU or request metrics.”

Health checks: “Each Target Group uses HTTP health checks to remove unhealthy tasks.”

Observability & Operations

Logging: “All logs go to a CloudWatch Log Group with a 7-day retention.”

Alerts & metrics: “I’d add CloudWatch Alarms on latency or error thresholds, and X-Ray tracing for deep diagnostics.”

Drift detection & CI/CD: “I’d store templates in Git, use CI to validate+linter, and deploy via CodePipeline or GitHub Actions.”

Cost & Optimization

Right-sizing: “I set modest CPU/memory; for dev you might use lower counts or shut down at night.”

Spot or Savings Plans: “Spot Fargate isn’t available yet, but you could use Savings Plans for Fargate or switch to EC2 Spot if needed.”
