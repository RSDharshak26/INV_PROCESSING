Think of a React component as a little machine with three main parts:

Setup (Imports & Declarations)
At the very top you import what you need: React itself, any hooks (useState, useEffect), other components, CSS, utilities, etc.

Logic & Data (“JavaScript Zone”)
Inside the function body (before the return), you:

Declare your state (with useState) and any effects (with useEffect).

Define event handlers or helper functions (like your handleSubmit).

Pull in data or do calculations based on props or state.

UI (“JSX Zone”)
After the return keyword you write JSX—this looks like HTML (with some JavaScript sprinkled in via { ... }) plus your CSS classes. React turns this JSX into actual DOM nodes.
